-Java (JDK 17)

-MySQL Database

-JDBC API

-Command-line Interface (CLI)

✅ Features

-➕ Add new patient records

-📋 View all registered patients

-👨‍⚕️ View doctor information

-📆 Book appointments by checking doctor availability

-🛡️ Input validation and database constraints

🧠 Learning Objectives

-Implement JDBC for database operations

-Use modular OOP principles in Java

-Apply SQL JOINs and foreign keys

-Handle user input, exceptions, and SQL queries effectively

📌 How It Works

1. Connects to a MySQL database (hospital schema).

2. Users can:
  
     -Add and view patients

     -View available doctors
